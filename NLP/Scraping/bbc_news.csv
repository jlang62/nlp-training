/news/world-australia-67340901,Optus outage: Millions affected by Australian network failure,,"Millions of Australians were left without mobile and internet after a network failure at telecoms firm Optus.
The failure caused transport delays, cut hospital phone lines, and shut down payment systems.
Optus, the country's second-largest provider, said more than 10 million people and thousands of businesses were affected.
Services were restored after around 12 hours of disruption. Optus said there was no evidence of a cyber attack.
The firm blamed a ""technical network fault"" and said more time would be needed to investigate the root cause.
Wednesday's disruption was reported around 04:00 (17:00 GMT). It took until around 18:00 for services to come back online.
Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, the company's chief executive, said it had not yet identified what went wrong.
People across Australia were unable to call emergency services and critical helpline numbers. Train services in the state of Victoria were also temporarily crippled.
The failures also affected other providers that use the Optus network, including Amaysim, Aussie Broadband, Moose Mobile, and more.
One Optus customer told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the incident had left her unable to receive important updates about her father's cancer treatment.
""I'm just waiting for results, and I can't even get those through,"" Danielle Hopwood said.
Another customer, Annie, told local radio she found out about the disruption when her cat's automatic wi-fi-enabled feeder failed.
Ms Rosmarin apologised for the network failure, telling ABC News: ""Until we've done a full, thorough, root-cause analysis, we really can't provide more information.
""What I can say is that it was a technical network issue, and that our teams have worked very, very hard to get services restored as quickly as they possibly could.""
She also rejected claims from unions that 600 job cuts were partly to blame.
""I don't think that that's at all related,"" she said. ""We're very sorry that this occurred and we will take all the learnings.""
The company last year suffered what was believed to be the biggest data breach in Australian history, as a result of a cyber attack.

/news/world-asia-67353331,Legend of Zelda: Nintendo & Sony making live-action movie,,"Nintendo and Sony Pictures are making a live-action film of the beloved video game series The Legend of Zelda.
Renowned video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad of the Spider-Man trilogy will co-produce, with The Maze Runner's Wes Ball directing. 
There is no word yet on who will make up the cast, or the plot of the film.
In a post on Nintendo's Japanese account on X, Mr Miyamoto revealed that he has been working on the film with Arad for some time.
He said that the development of the film has started, with Nintendo heavily involved in the production. 
""It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it,"" he wrote to fans.
It is Nintendo's second most successful franchise after Super Mario, having sold about 150 million copies since its debut in 1986.
Its latest iteration, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, sold 10 million copies in three days when it was released last May, making it the fastest-selling Zelda game of all time. 
Its predecessor Breath of the Wild is the best-selling game in the series, having sold an estimated 30 million copies overall.
The upcoming movie comes during a renaissance for gaming films, which were once thought to be almost guaranteed flops.
In the 90s, film adaptations of popular video games such as Super Mario Bros and Mortal Kombat were critical and commercial failures when they were released.
But Nintendo's star-studded Super Mario Bros Movie, which was released earlier this year, became one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time, earning more than $1bn (Â£800m) at the box office.
While Mario was the most successful, it is not a one-off. 
Films based on Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, starring Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz and James Marsden, have made hundreds of millions in box office takings, and Nintendo's Detective Pikachu, starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular PokÃ©mon, was a box office hit too.
The success of these movies will likely have spurred Nintendo to venture into film once again, with veteran producer Avi Arad at the helm.
Mr Arad has been responsible for most of the Spider-Man films since 2002, having previously led Marvel Studios.
He has a solid track record in video games too, having produced the 2022 Uncharted film starring Tom Holland - based on the massively popular video game series - which took $400m at the box office.
This will be the first attempt to make a Zelda film, though the franchise previously had an animated TV series in 1989. 
Netflix was later rumoured to be developing a new Zelda series in 2015 but nothing was ever released.

/news/world-australia-67354430,Australian farmer Colin Deveraux survives crocodile attack by biting back,,"An Australian farmer says he is lucky to be alive after repelling a crocodile attack by biting back at the animal.
Cattle producer Colin Deveraux has spent a month in hospital after being bitten by the 3.2m (10ft) saltwater crocodile in the Northern Territory.
He told ABC News he bit the crocodile's eyelid in his struggle to survive.
Mr Deveraux said his ordeal began after he stopped at a billabong (lake) while he was travelling to build fencing near the Finniss River last month.
He paused by the lake after noticing fish swimming in the middle of its retreating waters. After he stepped away again, the crocodile ""latched"" onto his right foot, shaking him like a ""rag doll"" and pulling him into the water.
Mr Deveraux told ABC he first tried kicking the crocodile in the ribs with his other foot - before biting the reptile back.
""I was in such an awkward positionâ¦ but by accident my teeth caught his eyelid. It was pretty thick, like holding onto leather, but I jerked back on his eyelid and he let go.
""I leapt away and took off with great steps up to where my car was. He chased me for a bit, maybe four metres, but then stopped.""
Mr Deveraux said he used a towel and some rope to stop the bleeding in his leg, before his brother drove him 130km (80 miles) north to the Royal Darwin Hospital.
""If he [the crocodile] had bitten me somewhere else it would have been different,"" he said.
""It means I've got to change what I do. I've been walking around that swamp country too long fixing fences and living life, but it's opened my eyes.""
According to the local government, crocodiles are the basis for an important industry in the Northern Territory and are protected by law.
They are considered to be of huge scientific and human interest as well as a valuable tourist attraction.
The last fatal crocodile attack happened in April this year on the Kennedy River in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland.

/news/uk-67344299,Nitrous oxide: Laughing gas possession becomes illegal,What does nitrous oxide do to the body?,"Possession of nitrous oxide, also known as NOS, has become a criminal offence in the UK. 
Now categorised as a class C drug, possession of laughing gas for its ""psychoactive effects"" will carry a sentence of up to two years in prison.
The government says the ban will combat anti-social behaviour and reduce damage to users' health.
Experts previously warned against a ban saying it would be disproportionate to the level of harm it causes.
Nitrous oxide is regularly used as a painkiller in medicine and dentistry. When mixed with oxygen, it is known as ""gas and air"", which can help reduce pain during childbirth.
But it is also one of the most commonly used recreational drugs by 16 to 24-year-olds. It causes short-term euphoria but can damage the nervous system.
Under the new rules, those found in unlawful possession of the drug could now face a prison sentence or unlimited fine, with up to 14 years for supply or production.
Earlier this year, experts reassessed the risk of nitrous oxide and stopped short of recommending a ban.
Toughening the law could have ""significant unintended consequences"" the Advisory Council on The Misuse of Drugs said, including users not seeking medical help.
But the government decided not to follow the advice, saying it ""is entitled and expected to take a broader view and consider other relevant factors."" 
It cited groups abusing the drug in public spaces, resulting in piles of discarded canisters. There have also been several deaths connected to drug driving incidents.
Birmingham has one of the highest hospital admission rates in the country for damage caused by its misuse.
A new BBC Three documentary found users there have moved beyond the small silver capsules of nitrous oxide often found littering gutters in cities, to bigger catering-sized canisters. 
One brand, Smartwhip, used legitimately to aerate cream and sauces in restaurants, is being sold surreptitiously to addicts in corner shops. Young men were filmed inflating balloons with NOS in moving cars, to avoid being seen. 
""We grew up as Muslims. Any form of intoxication is a no no,"" says community worker Naveed Sadiq.
He finds hundreds of Smartwhip canisters every week and says NOS use is a particular issue in his community. ""It's not like cannabis or alcohol - with this nobody knows, it's untraceable. A little bit of a giggle, and you go back home.""
However, after using NOS heavily for a year, Ali, had to be taken to rehab.
""It 'freezes' your brain,"" he says. ""I've blacked out from taking so much nitrous oxide that I've woken up after an hour, two hours.
""You're constantly tired, I wasn't able to eat food, I couldn't shower myself - I had lost all my independence. The five-second buzz is not worth what it's done to my life now.""
According to drugs information website Frank low levels of nitrous oxide use results in:
Habitual user Halima, not her real name, says nitrous oxide is ""one of the most addictive, nastiest things"" she has ever come across. She describes being so addicted to the gas that she ended up inhaling ""balloon after balloon after balloon"". 
""It got to the point where we'd stopped to go get a takeaway or something like that and... I would eat and then hop on the balloon and then eat and then hop on the balloon.""
Dr David Nicholl says patients come to him with tingling in their hands or feet, or difficulty walking, after inhaling the gas.
Intensive, frequent use of laughing gas can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause neurological damage, scientific studies suggest.
Dr Nicholl says this is because when nitrous oxide deprives the body of vitamin B12 the ""insulation"" around the spinal cord becomes damaged, meaning ""the electrical signals don't travel properly down from the brain, through the spinal cord to your nerves.""
Announcing the ban, Crime and Policing Minister Chris Philp said nitrous oxide abuse was dangerous to people's health.
""Today we are sending a clear signal to young people that there are consequences for misusing drugs. Both users and dealers will face the full force of the law for their actions,"" he added.

/news/world-australia-67353831,"Australia indefinite detention unlawful, High Court rules",,"Australia's top court has ruled that the government's power to hold a person indefinitely in immigration detention is unlawful. 
The landmark ruling overturns a 20-year-old precedent that has shaped Australia's border policies. 
It could trigger the release of 92 people in immigration detention who cannot return to their home countries, the government says.
The solicitor general warned it would prompt a wave of compensation claims. 
The case, heard before the High Court of Australia on Wednesday, involved a stateless Rohingya man - known by the pseudonym NZYQ - who faced the prospect of lifelong detention because no country would resettle him due to a criminal conviction for child sexual offences. 
The government had argued that his detention was lawful as they intended to remove him from the country - despite their inability to do so. 
The result overturns a 2004 case known as Al-Kateb v Godwin, which has faced several legal challenges over the years. 
In that verdict, the High Court had found that indefinite detention was lawful, as long as the government had the intention of eventually removing that person from Australia.
But in many cases, those facing deportation have argued they are stateless as they have nowhere to safely return, and no resettlement options. 
The result has been lengthy detention stays for some asylum seekers caught in Australia's system. 
According to the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC), the Australian government holds people in immigration detention for 708 days on average and there are currently 124 people who have been in detention for over five years - while historically, some cases have spanned more than a decade. 
In NZYQ's case, the court heard that several countries - including the UK, New Zealand, Canada, and the US - had refused to take him in, but the government maintained that a US resettlement was still possible. 
The HRLC's legal director Sanmati Verma said Wednesday's ruling would have ""life-changing consequences for people who have been detained for years without knowing when, or even if, they will ever be released"". 
In court, the government said it had identified 92 people currently in immigration detention under similar circumstances to NZYQ. 
Of those, nine are stateless, while most of the others cannot be returned home for fear of persecution. The court heard many of them were not being released on character grounds, with a few on the grounds of national security.
Ahead of the ruling, Australia's solicitor general Stephen Donaghue warned that overturning Al-Kateb would trigger their release, and that ""the consequence [would] be indefensible damages claims"".",Australia,2023-11-08 12:15:53.897798
/news/world-middle-east-67327079,'Iâm calling from Israeli intelligence. We have the order to bomb. You have two hours',"'We will bomb three towers', 'Fire a warning shot to prove this is real', A missed call from a private number, Mahmoud hangs up - but a neighbour's phone rings, More on Israel-Gaza war ","The call to Mahmoud Shaheen came at dawn.
It was Thursday 19 October at about 06:30, and Israel had been bombing Gaza for 12 days straight. 
He'd been in his third-floor, three-bedroom flat in al-Zahra, a middle-class area in the north of the Gaza Strip. Until now, it had been largely untouched by air strikes. 
He'd heard a rising clamour outside. People were screaming. ""You need to escape,"" somebody in the street shouted, ""because they will bomb the towers"".
As he left his building and crossed the road, looking for a safe place, his phone lit up.
It was a call from a private number. 
""I'm speaking with you from Israeli intelligence,"" a man said down the line, according to Mahmoud. 
That call would last more than an hour - and it would be the most terrifying call of his life.
The voice addressed Mahmoud by his full name and spoke in flawless Arabic. 
""He told me he wanted to bomb three towersâ¦ and ordered me to evacuate the surrounding area.""
Mahmoud's tower was not directly under threat - but he was suddenly responsible for evacuating hundreds of people. ""I had the lives of people in my hands,"" he says. 
He gathered his thoughts and told the man, who identified himself as Abu Khaled, not to hang up the phone.
As a 40-year-old dentist, Mahmoud says he has no idea why he was chosen for this task. But that day, he did everything he could to keep his community safe. 
Directed by the voices of strangers, who always seemed to know how to reach him even when his battery ran out, he pleaded for the bombing to stop and screamed until his throat hurt for people to run away. 
He led a mass evacuation of his neighbours - and then watched his neighbourhood explode in front of his eyes.
During this conflict, the Israeli military has phoned Gazans sometimes to warn them ahead of air strikes - Mahmoud's account gives an insight into one such phone call in an unprecedented level of detail.
The BBC contacted Mahmoud after multiple al-Zahra residents identified him as the man who received the warning call. 
We cannot independently verify the contents of the call, which he recounted roughly three weeks after the event. The details, however, match those on a community Facebook group from the day as well as satellite images before and after the bombing.
We know that day many hundreds of people were left homeless as the Israeli army bombed at least 25 residential blocks housing hundreds of apartments, destroying an entire neighbourhood. These people were forced to flee with what few belongings they could take, and were eventually dispersed across Gaza. 
The IDF says it strikes military targets and these actions are subject to the ""relevant provisions of international law"". 
Mahmoud could not believe it when the man began speaking, he recalls.
People around him warned that the call may be fake. Since the war had begun, messages had been circulating in the community Facebook group warning of hoax calls and offering tips on identifying real Israeli evacuation orders.
Mahmoud asked the voice on the phone to fire a warning shot to prove this was real. If those still sleeping did not hear the screams from the streets then they would hear the shot, he thought.
A warning shot seemingly from nowhere, but perhaps from a drone, hit one of the apartment blocks under threat, he says. 
""I asked him to 'shoot another warning shot before you bomb',"" Mahmoud says. One more rang out.
Now that Mahmoud knew it was real he tried to stall, asking the man to be patient. ""I told him: 'Don't betray us and bomb while people are still evacuating.'""
The man said he would give Mahmoud time - he said he did not want anyone to die, the dentist recalls.
Mahmoud responded that he didn't want anyone to even be injured.
He kept the call going as he rushed around the neighbourhood, urging people to evacuate. One neighbour remembers the dentist ""just shouting"", then others joined in. 
""I didn't want to know that there's someone I could have saved and I didn't,"" Mahmoud says.
Hundreds of people poured into the streets that morning. Residents of this usually peaceful city were screaming and running, some of them wearing their pyjamas or prayer clothes.
The area - just north of the Wadi Gaza river, a point that Israel has been ordering civilians to move south of since the early days of the war - was made up of modern blocks of flats as well as shops, cafes, universities, schools, and parks. It was in these parks that people began to gather.
Mahmoud could not understand why his neighbourhood had become a target. ""I tried my best to stop him. I asked, 'Why do you want to bomb?'
""He said, 'There are some things that we see that you don't see.'""
The man did not explain what he meant. 
""It is an order from people bigger than me and you, and we have an order to bomb,"" the voice added, according to Mahmoud.
When the areas around the buildings were clear the man informed Mahmoud that the bombing would begin.
Mahmoud panicked - what if they bombed the wrong building by mistake? ""Wait a bit,"" the man told him, he says.
An Israeli aircraft circled overhead. 
Mahmoud stared at the three towers that neighboured his own apartment block. Then one of them was bombed.
""This is the tower that we want, stay away,"" the man on the phone said as the building fell, according to Mahmoud.
The two other blocks were then destroyed.
Images taken in al-Zahra that morning show rubble in the place of those three apartment blocks, while a video shows residents wandering around in shock and bewilderment as they view the immediate aftermath of the strikes. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:28 local time says three towers had been ""wiped out completely"".
This video can not be played
Watch: The strikes that followed the phone call to Mahmoud Shaheen
When the bombing stopped, Mahmoud remembers the voice telling him: ""We've finishedâ¦ you can go back.""
Mahmoud didn't understand what he had just witnessed. He had lived in this Gaza neighbourhood for 15 years, running a busy dental practice and bringing up his children there.
""I told him al-Zahra is a civilian area. No one is a stranger hereâ¦ I tried to make him understand. It is not a border area, we have not had previous clashes. It was always an area outside of trouble,"" he says.
A post that morning on the community Facebook group urged neighbours to offer beds, food and water to those made homeless.
People searched for shelter or places to flee to. Local authorities started clearing the debris from the roads, and putting out fires in the rubble.
Those whose homes remained intact returned. Some people felt a sense of security.
""We went back [home], thinking they won't bomb again,"" one told us.
Later that day, Mahmoud had just finished his Isha, or night-time prayers, at his flat when he saw a missed call from a private number on his phone. 
His heart sank. ""Immediately I understood there would be an evacuation and bombing, but I didn't know what the target would be. I thought it might be my home, it might be the home next to me,"" he says.
His phone soon rang again. A different man was on the line.
The voice said they had realised Mahmoud was a ""wise man"" after the events of that morning, which is why they were calling him again.
The man introduced himself as Daoud.
Mahmoud was unnerved by the level of detail the man had about his life - by the familiar way the man addressed him and referred to his son's name.
According to Mahmoud's account, this man then made some attempt to explain what was happening in Gaza.
""He started telling me: 'Did you see how they [Hamas] slaughtered those children with knives?'â¦
""I told him that according to our Islamic religion, this is forbidden,"" Mahmoud recalls.
He urged the voice against ""mass punishment"", but Mahmoud knew it was hopeless.
Mahmoud says the man told him more buildings would be destroyed that night, and the dentist would need to order his neighbours to evacuate once again.
At first, he was told the targets were two buildings next to the three that had been destroyed that morning, as well as a second block of towers.
""He said to me, 'We want you to inform people to evacuate the area,' and I said, 'You need to give me time.'""
He got to work. ""We evacuated all the people and even evacuated a third block because it was so close to the second one,"" Mahmoud says.
At this point al-Zahra was largely in darkness. Residents say electricity had gone and they were using phones and torches for light as they filled the streets. Some had time to grab pre-packed bags as they left their homes, with items like spare clothing, water, phones and first aid kits. Others did not.
""It was absolute horror,"" one resident, Abdullah al-Khatib, says. ""We didn't know where to go. We literally just ran out, taking nothing.""
""Can't see clearly. Just evacuate,"" another says by WhatsApp message, recalling the events of that night. ""I just focus on being safe with family."" 
Mahmoud continued trying to buy as much time as he could, talking to the man who called himself Daoud until everyone was clear of the area and had been able to get into their cars if they wanted to drive away.
Three buildings were destroyed. As Mahmoud watched the destruction, the man on the phone said three more buildings would be bombed and then the residents would be allowed to return.
But a change of orders came suddenly.
They would bomb the full row of apartment blocks on the eastern side of the street, Mahmoud recalls being told.
This was more than 20 tower blocks, and hundreds of homes.
""There were people we hadn't evacuated yet because there was no warning about those buildings. I told him, 'At least give us until morning, in night time, where will the people go?'
""The answer was, 'The orders have been received, and we will bomb all towers within two hours.'""
Mahmoud screamed at people to clear the area, running from block to block.
Residents describe chaotic scenes of adults shouting and children weeping. Some parents and children lost one another in the melee.
Despite the panic, Mahmoud stayed on the phone the whole time, trying his best to delay the bombing.
The voice on the other end of the phone continued, without emotion.
""He even told me, 'Take your time. I won't bomb unless you give me permission.'
""I said 'No, it's not my permission. I don't want you to bomb anything. If you want me to evacuate, I will evacuate for the safety of the people, but if you want to bomb, don't tell me you need my permission.
""'It's not Mahmoud Shaheen who will bomb al-Zahra.'""
An elderly disabled woman lived in the last block of apartment buildings. Mahmoud and those around him told locals to ""drive like crazy"" to reach her and get her out.
He and others also worried about a local elderly care home. But the man on the phone said ""he'd just destroy the residential buildings"", according to Mahmoud.
Mahmoud says what he and his neighbours witnessed that night ""wasn't a small bombing"" but the ""complete destruction of buildings"", as the residential blocks were levelled one by one.
""It was a very hard night for all the people of al-Zahra.""
Photos and video footage posted by residents of the community show the aftermath of the evening bombing.
A post on the Facebook group at 21:11 local time says: ""Al-Zahra towers are being bombed right now. God have mercy.""
This video can not be played

One resident speaking to the BBC via WhatsApp message recalled the confusion in the streets. ""We didn't know where we should go - some said we must go to schools, some said we should go to Al Nuseirat [a refugee camp south of the neighbourhood]. During that [time] came cruel bombs.""
Mahmoud asked the man on the phone where he should take his neighbours.
""He said, 'Either take them east or west'. I said, 'To take them east will be hard, because to the east of al-Zahra is Al Mughraqa - an already unsafe area. People were already scared to go there.'
""He told me, 'Take them west to Palestine Street'. I suggested the University of Palestine and he said yes.""
Mahmoud led the crowd, which included not just residents of the tower blocks, but also other displaced people who had sought shelter in al-Zahra after fleeing their own homes elsewhere in northern Gaza.
Other residents have confirmed that they went to the university, and a video posted on the Facebook group shows people walking and driving in that direction, as the person behind the camera prays.
Your device may not support this visualisation
Mahmoud says people waited at the university in fear, listening to the drumming of explosions outside. Frightened dogs in the street tried to find a spot to lie down between women and children.
At one point, Mahmoud says the voice on the phone asked him how much battery he had left. He had 15%. They told him to hang up to preserve it and that they would call back again.
Frequent calls followed.
""They would ring to tell me, 'Now we will bomb another building,' 'Now we will bomb another one.' They said, 'We will keep calling until we finish,'"" Mahmoud says.
At one point a neighbour's phone rang, with the voice asking for Mahmoud Shaheen.
Mahmoud had been keeping his distance from his wife and five children all day - both because he was busy evacuating people and because he feared that his contact with Israeli intelligence made him a target.
At the university, he checked they were OK, and then left them again.
The residents of al-Zahra endured a sleepless night. The crowd looked to Mahmoud for updates and answers.
""[They were] saying 'Hey doctor, did they call you so we can go back? Did they tell you where they will hit?'""
Dawn broke. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:53 local time said: ""The bombing is still going on up to this moment.""
Videos shared overnight captured flashes of orange in the night sky. Others shot in the morning show plumes of grey smoke rising with the sun over the city. 
Mahmoud and the man who called himself Daoud kept speaking until the streets went quiet. Then the calls abruptly stopped without any further instructions for the people of al-Zahra.
""They didn't tell us to go back to our homes, or to evacuate or leave the area. So people waited until noon, and then they started to move,"" Mahmoud says.
In the hours and days that followed, the community of al-Zahra, like many in Gaza, disbanded.
""Even for the people whose homes were still standing, there are no services leftâ¦ the sewage systems are damaged, there is no bakery, there is no supermarket, there is no water, no electricity,"" Mahmoud says.
Mahmoud's block was not destroyed, although it was severely damaged. The neighbourhood where he built up his dental practice over 15 years, and became a linchpin of the community, is now gone. There is nothing left for him in al-Zahra.
He has taken his family to another region of Gaza, where he is staying in a friend's house that is crowded with people.
""I don't think about my clinic or my house, I just pray that I survive and stay alive,"" he says.
""Material things are nothing, you could die at any second right now. We don't think about anything else.""
Israel is known to have warned Gazans by calling them, texting them and dropping leaflets before bombing. But in some cases, civilians say they have not been warned ahead of time.
The IDF told the BBC that as part of its ""mission to dismantle the Hamas terrorist organisation [it] has been targeting military targets across the Gaza Strip"". Strikes on military targets were subject, it said, to ""relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties"". 
""Hamas continues to attack Israel from across the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire Gaza Strip. The IDF is determined to end these attacks and as such we will strike Hamas wherever necessary.""
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed by Israel since the war began - more than a third of them are children. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza followed Hamas gunmen rampaging into Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, including many women and children, and taking hundreds of others hostage.
Thanks to Mahmoud's efforts, it is believed that none of his neighbours died that day. But his account reveals the panic and anguish of a Palestinian community as they watched their homes and everything they love blow up around them.
The BBC has spoken to multiple families who lived in al-Zahra, a neighbourhood of professionals and entrepreneurs, in which families ate falafel and pizza on the beach together, and children played football in the dawn light as the call to prayer sounded across the rooftops.
In the second part of this story, we will bring you into the lives of the people who called this place home - of a prosperous and vibrant community that was eradicated overnight.

/news/world-us-canada-67354706,Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza comments,More on Israel-Gaza war ,"The US Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war.
Michigan Democrat Rahida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"".
The resolution formally condemned her for ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel"".
The measure passed by 234 to 188 votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure.
Ms Tlaib posted a video to Twitter on Friday that included a clip of protestors using the chant, which critics say calls for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel. 
The video also accused President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza and called for a ceasefire.
The Anti-Defamation League and Jewish groups say the slogan, used at protests around the world, is a call for the destruction of Israel.
Pro-Palestinian activists argue that most people using it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the elimination of Israel itself.
Ms Tlaib later defended her use of the slogan, calling it ""an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate."" 
The comment stirred up cross-party condemnation and criticism from allies in her own state, prompting two separate measures seeking to censure her.
Republican Representative Rich McCormick, who represents Georgia, introduced a resolution on Monday, accusing Ms Tlaib of ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives"" about Hamas's attack on Israel.
Twenty-two Democrats joined the vast majority of Republicans voting for Ms Tlaib's censure.
After the vote, Ms Tlaib told the house that her comments were directed at the Israeli government.
""I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings, just like anyone else,"" she said.
More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas. 
The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 10,300 Palestinians have since been killed in Israeli attacks.
The Biden administration has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in favour of a humanitarian pause to allow aid, food and water into Gaza.

/news/world-us-canada-67352011,Ohio votes to add abortion rights to state constitution,More on US abortion debate,"Ohio voted to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution on Tuesday, marking a major victory for pro-choice campaigners in the state.
The BBC's US partner CBS News projected a decisive victory for the amendment.
Early returns showed almost 56% of voters in the conservative-leaning state had backed it.
Its success is likely to bolster Democrats' hopes that abortion rights remain a winning issue ahead of elections in 2024.
It also extends an unbeaten record for ballot measures designed to protect abortion rights since the nationwide right to the procedure was rescinded by the Supreme Court last year. This is the seventh such measure to pass. 
But Ohio's measure, known as Issue 1, was widely seen as the toughest fight so far for abortion rights supporters as it was the first Republican-led state to consider changing its constitution to explicitly guarantee the right.
The amendment will change the state's constitution to include protections for abortion access. It will establish ""an individual right to one's own reproductive medical treatment"", including on abortion, contraception and miscarriage care.
Supporters of the amendment warned voters that unless it passed, more restrictive laws could be introduced including a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions.
Abortion is currently legal in Ohio until 22 weeks of pregnancy. 
Those who campaigned against the measure, however, argued that it would allow late term abortions that are currently illegal. 
As votes were still being counted into the early hours, there were emotional celebrations from pro-choice supporters as US media projected the constitutional amendment would pass.
""This is one of the greatest moments of my life, working so hard with my team beside me to achieve reproductive rights and freedoms in Ohio,"" Kate Gillie told the BBC at one watch party.
""We've got two little girls and this is about their future and their reproductive rights,"" another person at the party, Frank Tedeschi, said.
One of the leading groups that opposed the amendment, Protect Women Ohio, has reportedly raised almost $10m (Â£8.1m) since September.
In a statement, the group said: ""Our hearts are broken tonight not because we lost an election, but because Ohio families, women and children will bear the brunt of this vote.""
""We stand ready during this unthinkable time to advocate for women and the unborn,"" it added.
The amendment will change the state's constitution to include protections for abortion access. It will establish ""an individual right to one's own reproductive medical treatment"", including on abortion, contraception and miscarriage care.
It explicitly prohibits the state from ""directly or indirectly burdening, penalising or prohibiting abortion"" before viability, which is generally considered to be around 23 weeks of pregnancy.
The amendment does allows the state to bar abortion after the point of viability except in instances where the patient's doctor determines the procedure is needed to protect life or health. 
Opponents of the measure have expressed concern over this element, telling voters it would allow for ""late-term abortions"" - a non-medical term referring to abortions later in pregnancy. 
But supporters of Issue 1 argued that any abortions later in pregnancy would require sign-off from a medical professional attesting to serious health concerns.
Ohio Republicans, who control the legislature and governorship, hinted they would introduce new ballot measures around abortion in response.
Jason Stephens, the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, promised his supporters that there are ""multiple paths we will explore to continue to protect innocent life"".
Tuesday's result offers clues about voters' views on abortion more than a year after Roe was overturned. 
Democrats, including President Joe Biden, will hope the issue continues to energise voters ahead of next year's elections.
""Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans,"" Mr Biden said in a statement on Tuesday night. 
Two other elections on Tuesday, one in Kentucky, the other in Virginia, will also impact abortion access in the months ahead. 
In the southern state of Kentucky, the re-election of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear, who ran ads attacking his opponent on his strict anti-abortion stance, is being considered a win for activists fighting to maintain abortion access in the state.  
And in Virginia, Democrats - who campaigned against Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin's push to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy - won control of both legislative chambers.
The results in Ohio are also being watched in Arizona and Missouri, states that are both considering including similar ballot measures next year.

/sport/rugby-union/67349016,Wayne Barnes: Rugby World Cup final referee on social media abuse he and family faced,,"Last updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Rugby Union
World Cup final referee Wayne Barnes revealed ""vile"" social media abuse towards him and his family ""crossed a line"" and he wants those responsible to be punished.
Barnes retired a few days after taking charge of South Africa's 12-11 win over New Zealand in the final in Paris.
His wife, Polly, previously said Barnes received death threatsexternal-link after the match.
""When people make threats against your wife and kids, they should be held to account and punished,"" Barnes said.
Barnes has taken charge of a record 111 Tests, which included officiating at five World Cups.
He showed the first-ever red card in a final to New Zealand captain Sam Cane for a high tackle as South Africa retained their title.
In his first interview since announcing his retirement, Barnes said he believed social media abuse was getting worse.
""Threats of sexual violence, threats of saying we know where you live. It crosses that line,"" he told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.
""Social media is getting worse and it's the sad thing about the sport at the moment. It has not been a one-off.
""I'm on social media for numerous reasons. One is to promote the charitable work I do and to also promote officiating and to explain what a difficult job it is and to humanise it.
""I make that choice, and with that choice comes the ability for people to send messages of hate and violence.""
Barnes said while he was able to ""compartmentalise"" the negative side of social media, he struggled when his family were subject to abuse.
""If you're a fan at your local rugby club and you're sending vile messages to people's families and making threats, why should you be able to be involved in the rugby family?"" he said.
""The bit I've always struggled with and will continue to struggle with is when that abuse comes to my family.
""I want prosecuting agencies to consider ways of doing that, I want legislation of what social media sites can do to prevent it and I also want governing bodies to consider what they can do.""
Barnes said footage of football referee Anthony Taylor being abused by fans earlier this year had ""made his heart bleed"".
Taylor was confronted by Roma boss Jose Mourinho after he officiated in the Europa League final in May.
Mourinho was given a four-match ban for the incident but Taylor and his familyexternal-link were shouted at by angry fans in Budapest Airport, with one person being charged with affray, according to airport officials.
""It was hugely sad. That could easily have been me and my family after a game,"" Barnes said.
""I remember watching that video of Anthony and I was devastated because you see the human side.
""People don't see the human side of refereeing. They think we are the man or woman who turn up on a Saturday afternoon who ruin their day. But we are actually human beings with families and kids and to see Anthony on that day absolutely broke me.
""People in positions of responsibility have to realise our actions have consequences. You can't pick up your phone and abuse people. We need to be better.""
Athletes from a number of sports have called out abuse on social media. Social media platforms have said they are committed to tackling abuse, with Instagram introducing a tool in 2021 to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow on the platform.
In his autobiography Throwing the Book, Barnes describes the abuse he has received in the past, which led him to consider quitting as a referee on several occasions.
The Englishman was also subjected to abuse after sending off France captain Antoine Dupont and South Africa flanker Steph du Toit in the Springboks' defeat in Marseille last year.
Barnes says it was a moment that could have fast-tracked his retirement as the abuse became more intense following criticism from South Africa director of rugby Rassie Erasmus.
""Without doubt, it was a moment where you think 'why do we do this?'"" he said.
""But then you sit down and talk about it and realise there is only 10 months to go [until the World Cup] and you don't want the keyboard warriors to win.""
As well as his role as a referee, Barnes is also a lawyer and an advocate for officiating across all sports.
Barnes says football's use of the video assistant referee (VAR) still has some work to do to emulate the success of the television match official (TMO) in rugby union.
""Football has only had VAR in play for two or three years so they are still in that evolutionary period,"" he said.
""Rugby has been using TMO for over 20 years so we have been able to work on it. It is work in progress for VAR.
""The one thing we learned from rugby league in rugby union was a way of involving the fans. I went to Brentford v West Ham last weekend and what was really noticeable was that I didn't know something was being reviewed.
""After two or three minutes, as the crowd got a bit restless, it said video check over and the goal stood. I didn't know what, or where or how until I watched highlights on Match of the Day.
""I still think there is still a way to go in rugby. You sit there at Twickenham and you might see the replays but you don't hear what the referee is saying unless you're watching on TV.
""There is definitely an element we can improve for the fan experience because we want people in the stadium and I think all sports can learn from each other.""",,2023-11-08 12:15:54.368839
/news/science-environment-67332791,Global heat: 'Exceptional' autumn sets 2023 up to break records,"'Record human suffering', Impacts of rising temperatures seen across the world","It is now ""virtually certain"" that 2023 - a year of deadly heatwaves, floods and fires - will be the warmest on record, new data suggests.
The prediction follows ""exceptional"" high October temperatures.
Global average air temperatures were 0.4C warmer than the previous high of October 2019, according to the EU's climate change service.
Driven by carbon emissions and an El NiÃ±o weather event, this was the fifth month in a row of record warmth.
Extreme global temperatures will likely continue into 2024, researchers say.
That this year will be the warmest ever recorded is now pretty much unavoidable: the last two months of 2023 are extremely unlikely to reverse the trend and high temperatures around the world have continued into November.
October's temperature mark adds to this year's list of tumbling global heat records. 
The number of days breaking through the politically significant 1.5C warming threshold has already reached a new high, well before the end of the year.
July was so warm that it may have been the hottest month in 120,000 years, while average September temperatures smashed the previous record by a ""gobsmacking"" 0.5C.
October was not quite as unusually hot as September but still breaks the record for the month by an ""exceptional"" margin, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. 
The month was 1.7C warmer than the pre-industrial average - meaning compared with the period before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.  
The warmth experienced throughout the year so far means that 2023 is ""virtually certain"" to become the world's warmest year on record, beating 2016. 
That's the view of a number of science bodies, including Copernicus and US groups NOAA and Berkeley Earth.
""We really see no sign that this year's string of exceptional record-setting months is going away anytime soon,"" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. 
""And at this point, it makes it virtually certain in all the datasets that 2023 will be the warmest year on record. That's a greater than 99% chance,"" he told BBC News.
While many researchers are concerned about the scientific impacts of record-breaking temperatures this year, others point to the fact that the rising mercury has real world consequences. 
""The fact that we're seeing this record hot year means record human suffering,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from Imperial College London, commenting on the findings.
""Within this year, extreme heatwaves and droughts made much worse by these extreme temperatures have caused thousands of deaths, people losing their livelihoods, being displaced etc. These are the records that matter.""
The main driver of the heat is ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide, mainly from burning fossil fuels. It is being supplemented this year by the rise of El NiÃ±o - a natural event where warm waters come to the surface in the east Pacific Ocean and release extra heat into the atmosphere. 
El NiÃ±o conditions have gained strength over recent months, but have not yet reached their peak. 
""This El NiÃ±o is weird. Part of the heat we're experiencing is not just due to the increase in El NiÃ±o, it's due to this rapid switch out of (ocean-cooling weather event) La NiÃ±a conditions as well, that has been suppressing temperatures for the last few years,"" said Dr Hausfather. 
Scientists are uncertain as to whether this NiÃ±o event is different from others in recent decades. Some are concerned that it might be driving greater heating at the ocean surface than during previous events such as the ones in 1997 and 2015. The jury is still out on that.
The year to date has been a record 1.43C warmer than the pre-industrial levels according to Copernicus, with temperatures expected to remain high in the coming months.
Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said that a combination of its data and that of the UN suggested 2023 may be ""warmer than anything that the planet has seen for 125,000 years"".
That conclusion is based on observations at weather stations, complex computer models of the climate system, and records of the climate far back in time from ice cores and tree rings, for example.
It sets the worrying climate context ahead of the UN's COP28 summit, which begins on 30 November.
""The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher,"" said Dr Burgess.
October temperatures were much higher than average globally, and different parts of the world faced extreme conditions.
High temperatures around the world have continued into November with hundreds of heat records already broken this month in Japan.
Europe meanwhile saw temperatures over 35C for the first time ever in November, with high readings in several parts of Greece. 
As these temperatures surge, there are concerns that further extreme events may follow in the coming months.
For example, parts of Australia have already been warned of an ""increased risk"" of wildfires.",Science & Environment,2023-11-08 12:15:54.483803

/news/uk-wales-67344916,AI: Fears hundreds of children globally used in naked images,"What is AI and how does it work?, What rules are in place at the moment about AI?","The mother of a girl whose photo was used in AI-generated naked images says hundreds of parents have told her their children are also victims.
Miriam Al Adib's daughter was one of several children from a Spanish village who had indecent images created using photos of them fully clothed. 
She says parents around the world claim their children have also been targeted.
One Welsh teacher said schools needed to play a role in explaining the dangers of AI to children.
The Internet Watch Foundation said it was ""not surprising"" the practice was so widespread.
The town ofÂ AlmendralejoÂ hit headlines in September after more than 20 girls, aged between 11-17 had AI-generated indecent images shared online without their knowledge.
Mrs Al Adib was among a group of parents who created a support group for those affected, which she said led to many other parents contacting her with their own concerns.
""Hundreds of people have written to me saying 'how lucky you have been [to have support] because this same thing has happened to us, it happened to my daughter, or it happened to me, and I haven't had any support',"" she told Wales Live.
""If any girl is affected, please tell your parents.""
Ms Al Adib said mothers and fathers of those affected in her village had started a group to help support each other and their children.
She added: ""This helped many girls to come forward to also say what had happened to them. It is important to know, because many girls are not able do not dare to talk about this with their parents.""
She said the combination of access to social networks, pornography and artificial intelligence was a ""weapon of destruction"". 
The UK's first AI safety summit last week heard Home Secretary Suella Braverman commit to clamp down on AI-generated child sexual abuse material.
The UK government said: ""AI-generated child sexual exploitation and abuse content is illegal, regardless of whether it depicts a real child or not. 
""The Online Safety Act will require companies to take proactive action in tackling all forms of online child sexual abuse - including grooming, live-streaming, child sexual abuse material and prohibited images of children - or face huge fines.""
Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said child sexual abuse material generated through AI needs to be addressed ""urgently"".
She said she was concerned there could be a ""tsunami"" of images created in the future.
""That's because it's not something that's about to happen. It is happening,"" she said.
In their October 2023 report, the foundation found that in just one month more than 20,000 AI-generated images were found on one forum which shares child sexual abuse material.
Comments included congratulations for creators on the realism of pictures, and users saying they had created images from pictures they'd taken of children in a park.
Dr Tamasine Preece, who leads health and wellbeing at Bryntirion Comprehensive school in Bridgend, said things like social media and smart phones mean her role has changed ""immeasurably"" since she started teaching.
She said it was ""absolutely vital schools play a pivotal role"" in working with children about topics like the dangers of AI.
Wales Live showed her an advert which claims an app can generate nude photos, which she described as ""heart-breaking'.
""We as adults can bring them out into the foreground in a safe way rather than these subjects being taboo and discussed amongst themselves sharing misinformation,"" she added.
The Lucy Faithful Foundation, which works with offenders to tackle child sexual abuse, said it was bracing itself for an ""explosion"" of child sexual abuse material created by AI.
AI (artificial intelligence) allows computers to learn and solve problems almost like a person.
AI systems are trained on huge amounts of information and learn to identify the patterns in it, in order carry out tasks such as having human-like conversation, or predicting a product an online shopper might buy.
The technology is behind the voice-controlled virtual assistants Siri and Alexa, and helps Facebook and X - formerly known as Twitter- decide which social media posts to show users.
Many experts are surprised by how quickly AI has developed, and fear its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted.
In October, the UK government published a report which said AI might soon assist hackers to launch cyberattacks or help terrorists plan chemical attacks.
In the EU, the Artificial Intelligence Act, when it becomes law, will impose strict controls on high risk systems.
The UK government previously ruled out setting up a dedicated AI watchdog.
But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants the UK to be a leader in AI safety, and is hosting a global summit at Bletchley Park where firms and governments are discussing how to tackle the risks posed by the technology.

/news/newsbeat-67355245,Bad Bunny not happy about AI track using his voice,,"Rapper Bad Bunny has released a furious rant about a viral TikTok song that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to replicate his voice.
The track NostalgIA has hundreds of thousands of views and also uses vocals from Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee. 
In a post on his WhatsApp channel, Bad Bunny said anyone who liked the song should leave the group.
""You don't deserve to be my friends,"" the singer wrote in Spanish. ""I don't want them on the tour either.""
The 29-year-old Puerto Rican artist also used expletives to describe the track in the post on WhatsApp, where he has 19 million followers.
The uploader suggests it was made using AI platform FlowGPT. 
Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio MartÃ­nez Ocasio, is rumoured to be in a relationship with model Kendall Jenner - but the pair haven't confirmed this publicly.
BBC Newsbeat has approached Bad Bunny's record label for a comment about the AI track.
Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee haven't publicly commented on it, but Newsbeat has reached out to them too.
It's not the first time stars have hit out at AI-generated tracks.
In April, Drake and The Weeknd had their voices cloned for Heart On My Sleeve by a creator known as @ghostwriter.
The song went viral online and later had to be removed from Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer after Drake said it was ""the final straw"".
The software works by analysing huge amounts of music in order to create something new - but there are currently no clear laws in place about who owns the copyright.
However, some people in the industry have said AI can be a useful tool for creating music and the technology should be embraced. 
In an interview with the BBC, the boss of Spotify said it wouldn't ban AI tracks from the platform, but drew the line at artists' voices being cloned.
